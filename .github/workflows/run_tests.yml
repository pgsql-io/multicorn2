      # Seems to be a bug in setup-nix-cache-action where, even though we're only providing a trusted_public_keys input
      # and no secret_keys input, it still tries to create a post-build-hook that will push packages to the cache.  This
      # is a hacky workaround to remove that hook -- we find the post-build-hook created by setup-nix-cache-action and
      # truncate it to 0 bytes so it does nothing.
